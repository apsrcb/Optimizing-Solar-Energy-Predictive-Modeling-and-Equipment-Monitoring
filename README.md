# Optimizing Solar Energy: Predictive Modeling and Equipment Monitoring

## Problem statement:

The goal of this project is to develop Machine Learning models that accurately predict Solar Power Generation based on historical data from two different datasets: Solar Power Plant and Weather data. The project aims to address the following challenges:

1. Variability in Solar Power Generation: Solar power generation is highly dependent on various factors, such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal changes. Therefore, accurately predicting solar power generation is crucial for optimizing the integration of solar energy into the power grid and ensuring efficient energy management.

2. Combining Multiple Datasets: The project involves integrating data from two distinct sources: Solar Power Plant and Weather data. The challenge is to effectively combine these datasets to capture the relationship between solar power generation and weather conditions, considering factors such as temperature, irradiation, DC power, and weather.

3. Handling Missing or Incomplete Data: Datasets collected from solar power plants and weather stations may contain missing or incomplete data due to various reasons, such as sensor failures or maintenance issues. Dealing with missing data poses a challenge in training the machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

4. Accuracy and Robustness: The developed machine learning model should be accurate and robust to handle different scenarios and generalize well to unseen data. It should be able to adapt to changing weather patterns, seasonal variations, and different solar power plant locations.

The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques, such as Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regression, to predict solar power generation based on the dataset. Additionally, the code performs fault identification, calculates fault statistics, and generates visualizations to analyze and display the occurrence of faults in different time periods and inverters. This provides valuable insights into the operation and performance of the solar power plant.

By achieving accurate predictions and effectively analyzing fault occurrences, this project aims to assist in efficient energy management, optimize power grid integration, and facilitate the utilization of solar power as a sustainable energy source.
